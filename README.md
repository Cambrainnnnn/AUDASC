# AUDASC -- Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Acoustic Scene Classification

### Welcome to the repository of the AUDASC method. 

Full description of the method along with obtained 
results can be found at the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05777). The paper is submitted to the [Detection
and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events workshop (DCASE)](http://dcase.community/) 2018.
